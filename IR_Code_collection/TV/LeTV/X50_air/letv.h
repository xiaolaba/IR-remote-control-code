/*
 IR remote control model, LeTV
 IR remote signal, NEC, RAW code 0x32A6xxxx, 
 that is result of LSB first send first of a byte
 ie. 0x32 = 0b 0011,0010, send it MSB fisrt, but store LSB first, became  0b 0100,1100 = 0x4C
 ie. 0xA6 = 0b 1010,0110, send it MSB fisrt, but store LSB first, became  0b 0110,0101 = 0x65

 +0x0100, see https://xiaolaba.wordpress.com/2018/10/28/sdcc-0x0100-bug-if-0x01-or-0x7b/
 one used ~() operator, not just inverting bit, it has -0x0100 due to C-preprocessor
 do not know why, but it is something C and the style,
 perhaps 2's completment 
 https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators

 # Twist in bitwise complement operator in C Programming
 # The bitwise complement of 35 (~35) is -36 instead of 220, but why?
 # For any integer n, bitwise complement of n will be -(n+1). To understand this, you should have the knowledge of 2's complement.
